Some game variables can be changed using a configuration file like {\ttfamily game.\+config} (configuration file reading is powered by Richard J. Wagner\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://ai.stanford.edu/~gal/Code/FindMotifs/ConfigFile.h}{\texttt{ Config\+File}}). The configuration file is passed as an argument to the executable\+:

{\ttfamily ./game game.\+config}

The example configuration lists all the possible configurations each accompanied by a small explanation.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Compilation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
The included makefile can be used to compile the code. To compile and run the code type {\ttfamily make} in your terminal. \`{}make compile will compile the code but not run it. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{doxygen}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
